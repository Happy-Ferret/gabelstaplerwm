# Concept draft
Main design aspect is the maximal independency of components: it should be
very simple to remove tags, bar(s), fancy layouts etc.
That way, users can choose components and replace/extend at will.

## General component ideas
* just tiling a specific area of the screen
* a modal interface of sorts?
* additional functionality (mouse-replacement etc) is placed in additional modules
* tags work similarly to awesomeWM: N:M relationship between windows and tags
  * rulesets decide upon the placement of clients
* scratchpad or similar concept
* a simple bar/"privileged windows"
* notification support
