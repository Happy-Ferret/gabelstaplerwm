# gabelstaperwm
gabelstaplerwm is a semidynamic tiling window manager written in the Rust
programming language and using the XCB wrappers available. It's main design
goals are simplicity, correctness in behaviour and configurability, coupled
with compile-time configuration by the user, minimizing overhead at runtime
and allowing for sophisticated dynamic behaviour.

## Concepts
gabelstaplerwm is inspired by dwm and awesomewm, adding a few ideas of it's own
to the concept of a dynamic window manager. It shares the tag idiom with it's
ancestors-in-spirit, but implements a slightly different approach at managing
them. The author believes this is the most flexible solution achieved using
such a system, while still efficient to implement and use.

### What are tags at all?
TODO: describe differences to awesome/dwm style tags

### How do you use them?

### Why doesn't it have X?
